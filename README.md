# weather-dashboard
I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that I can plan a trip accordingly

This weather dashboard was made using javascript. It dynamically creates HTML elements to display for the user containing information supplied by an API.

# Objectives
- Fetch API's from weathermap.org
- Use an API to give coordinates
- Use an API to get today's forecast
- Use an API to get five day forecast
- Display Weather information for a searched City
- Display the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed for today, as well as for the five-day forecast
- Add recently searched cities to a search history
